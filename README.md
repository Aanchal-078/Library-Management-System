# Library-Management-System
This project involves designing a Library Management System where users can first log in and then perform actions like borrowing or returning books. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to recommend books to users based on their previous searches and borrowing history, enhancing personalization. Additionally, a Power BI dashboard was created to fetch live data and analyze user behavior. The dashboard provides insights into trends such as which age group or gender is borrowing the most books, and which books are trending across different demographics. This comprehensive system combines efficient library operations with data-driven recommendations and analytics to improve user engagement and resource management.
